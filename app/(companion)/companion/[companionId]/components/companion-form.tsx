const SEED_CHAT = `User: Hey there! I'm working on a new track and could use some help with the mix.

AI: Hey! I'd love to help out. What specifically are you looking to improve in your mix?

User: The bass and drums are clashing a bit, and I'm having trouble making the vocals sit well in the mix.

AI: Got it. It sounds like there might be some frequency overlap between the bass and drums. Have you tried carving out some space in the EQ for each instrument?

User: I have cut some lows from the drums and boosted the bass around 80Hz, but it still doesn’t sound right.

AI: It's great that you've made those adjustments. Sometimes the clashing can also be because of the kick drum. Try sidechain compressing the bass to the kick drum. This will make the bass dip slightly every time the kick hits, creating more space in the mix. Also, for the vocals, have you applied any compression or EQ?

User: I have added some compression to the vocals, but I haven’t done much EQ.

AI: Compression is a good start. For the EQ on vocals, a common approach is to do a high-pass filter to remove unnecessary low frequencies, a slight boost in the high-mids for presence, and sometimes a small cut in the mid-range to avoid muddiness. Additionally, adding a touch of reverb can also help the vocals sit better in the mix. Would you like some suggestions on reverb settings?

User: Yes, that would be great. I am using a plate reverb right now.

AI: Plate reverb is a great choice for vocals. Try starting with a decay time of around 1.5-2 seconds and adjust from there to taste. Also, roll off some low frequencies on the reverb to avoid it getting too muddy. Lastly, make sure the wet/dry mix is not too high, start at around 20% and adjust to taste.

User: Awesome, I will try those settings. Thanks for your help!

AI: You're welcome! Feel free to reach out anytime if you need more help. Happy mixing!`
